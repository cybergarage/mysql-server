# Bug#37338915 [InnoDB] Difficult to find free blocks in the buffer pool (390148 search iterations)!
# This test prepares a quite big table and then modifies all its pages and hope
# they will be modified in quite sequential order. The recovery then should be
# able to issue bigger batches of consecutive pages to read to recover.
# During recovery half of BP, 2.5MB or 40 pages, will be assigned to redo
# hashmap, which will due to batching take up more than 60 pages.
# This works only for 64KB pages, as otherwise we would not have less than 30
# pages (a maximum size of batch of consecutive pages to read in recovery) left
# for LRU pages even for the minimum BP size. The page size is  set in the .opt
# file.
# This test is not deterministic for some reason, it sometimes leaves 20-21
# pages left in LRU and passes without a fix, and sometimes required 19 pages.
