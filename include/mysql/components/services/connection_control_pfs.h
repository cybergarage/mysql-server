  Option tracker registration and deregistration services

  This is a service that will allow registering an option.
  Each option has a name. The name is UTF8mb4 and is unique in
  the list.
  Manipulating the option list is an "expesive" operation since there
  is a global lock involved.

  Each code container (a component or a plugin) should register its
  options during its initialization and should unregister them during
  its deinitialization.
